  <p>As <a href="https://www.naver.com/"target="_blank" title="html5 specification">President</a> Trump heads into one of the most critical phases of the special counsel
  investigation,<br> his personal legal team has shrunk to essentially just one member</br>,
   and he is struggling to find any top lawyers willing to represent him.</p>

  <p>Working for a president is usually seen as a dream job. But leading white-collar lawyers
  in <a href="https://www.naver.com/" >Washington</a> and New York have repeatedly spurned overtures to take over the defense of
  Mr. Trump, a mercurial client who often ignores his advisers guidance. In some cases,
  lawyers firms have blocked any talks, fearing a backlash that would hurt business.
  The president lost two lawyers in just the past four days, including one who had been on
  board for less than a week.</p>
